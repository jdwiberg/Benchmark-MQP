Thanks so much. I think that, given what was possible, we got a very good result. Thanks for all your unwavering support throughout the year and for the pivotal role you played in the final 48 hours. Your diplomacy Thursday was hugely important, starting to shift things in our direction, and then the President's intervention Friday put us over the top. An awesome 1-2 punch -- the best in the whole wide world. I'm honored every single day to work for you. Hope you get some rest over the holidays. Best, Todd Original Message-- From: H (mailto:HDR22@clintonemail.com] Sent: Tuesday, December 22, 2009 10:06 AM To: Stern, Todd D (S/SECC) Subject: Onward!
