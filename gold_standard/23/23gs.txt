Last week, Dr. Amanda Rivera from Boston General Hospital called Jonathan Liu to discuss his recent MRI scan results. 
She mentioned that although his cholesterol levels were high, his blood pressure had improved since April. 
Jonathan agreed to share the report with BlueShield Insurance Group and his therapist, Maria O’Neill, for follow-up. 
Later that day, he emailed the documents from his personal address jonliu87@gmail.com and included his member ID BS-9032114. 
His sister Emily, who lives at 45 Chestnut St., Cambridge, MA, reminded him to attend his virtual PTSD support group on Thursday. 
Dr. Rivera also cited a recent NIH study (Ref. No. 2024-H-1127) suggesting a link between sleep quality and anxiety recovery.
