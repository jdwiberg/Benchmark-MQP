Alex: Hey, I just heard back from Boston Children’s Hospital. Dr. Shah moved my appointment to March 14 at 10:30 AM.
Priya: Got it. Is that still at the Longwood Medical Area?
Alex: Yeah, same place. They said it’s under patient ID BC-44721.
Priya: Perfect. Do you still have Blue Cross Blue Shield for insurance?
Alex: I do. If anything changes, they told me to call (617) 355 6000.
