Hi Sandra, just wanted to follow up about the new partnership between Harbor Analytics and Westfield Energy. I spoke with Daniel Ruiz earlier today, and he mentioned that his colleague, Maria Thompson, will handle the financial disclosures once her doctor clears her to return after shoulder surgery. You can reach Daniel at druiz@westfieldenergy.com or on his cell at 617-438-9924 if anything urgent comes up. Also, please make sure the shipment records are sent to 48 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108, before Friday. I’ll copy the operations lead, Kevin Lau, on this thread to keep him in the loop.
