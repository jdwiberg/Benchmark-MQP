Subject: EOTT Hunt Pipeline Update

Stan & Phil, a quick update on the status of our activities on the
Pipeline this week.

On Monday, Jordan and David Sztroin drove as much of the pipeline as
possible in preparation for Tuesday's meeting.
On Tuesday, Jordan, David and Dan Cole met with representatives from Boots
Smith Construction in Laurel, MS to discuss the project.  Discussion centered
around the pipe size (1018 being the most likely), and what was included in
the lump sum construction price from Boots Smith. His price did not include a number of items, such as concrete coating, stream crossings, wetlands installation (including mats), Directional drills, silt fencing, and several other identified items.
He has provided, or will provide, unit prices for some of these items; we will estimate the balance.
I have assigned Jordan as the Project Director for the project. He is working to more clearly define the scope, standards, specifications, execution approach, cost, and schedule. We will advise the target schedule and revised cost estimate as soon as possible. Of course, there are many permitting and environmental issues to overcome, and Jordan is working through those now; the survey needs to start ASAP in order to file for the permits.
Best, Dan
