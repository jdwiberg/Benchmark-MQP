Hi,

Harry would like to meet with us to get buy-in for the development time-table 
of FileOpen deliverables for the dataroom.

This is in the light of the impending signing-off on the design 
specifications for FileOpen Systems.

I have attached that document for reference

Could you please confirm 1:30 pm today, on the 27th floor, next to the Chairman's office.

Regards

Tobias
