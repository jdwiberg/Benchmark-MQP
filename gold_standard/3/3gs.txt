The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of 
tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.  He is 
buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.  If you are interested in the 
9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you 
for $305.  Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the 
weekend.  You can reach me at work or anytime this weekend on my cell phone.  
If you are interested please call me at 713-853-5933 (work) or 713-516-8820 
(cell) and we will work it out.  FYI - Also notifying the person who bid 
$305 and promised to give them first look

Thanks,

Martin
