Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this 
year.  The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.  You will have 
until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  You 
should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points 
you want to bid. Everyone will start with 
100 points and get more points based on weekly finishes (1 point for 
highest score and 12 points for lowest score).
