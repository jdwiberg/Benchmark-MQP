Subject: Hedge Fund Update & Summary

Fred asked me to pull together an update for you on our dealings with Hedge 
Funds. Look forward to seeing you at 2PM today.

We have active trading relationships with two hedge Funds, Tudor & Ospraie, 
and have documentation negotiations under way with 11 others. In addition, we 
were trading with Tiger earlier in the year before they closed down. The 
commodity traders I dealt with at Tiger (Paul Touradji & Rob Ellis) are in 
the process of setting up their own hedge fund and will trade with us again 
in late Autumn.

2000 Hedge Fund Origination Summary

Tiger   $112,000  (began trading in Dec 99 and stopped in Mar 00)
Tudor   $384,700 (began trading in Mar 00)
Ospraie  $589,940 (began trading in May 00)

Total year to date $1,086,640 (My budget est for 2000 is approx $2mm)

I've attached two files. The first is a spread sheet with all our hedge fund 
trades year to date in detail. In there you will see a tab for work in 
progress, these are the funds I am targeting to get signed on for trading 
with us and the state of play with each.
